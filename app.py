**Bing News Search API**

We use the Bing News Search API to fetch the latest news articles related to your chosen company or topic. This allows us to aggregate up to 150 recent articles from various reputable sources. The aggregated news is then used for sentiment analysis and summarization, providing insights into market sentiment and potential impacts on stock prices.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**OpenAI API**

We leverage the OpenAI API to perform natural language processing tasks. Specifically, we use it to generate concise summaries of news headlines and analyze the overall sentiment of the news articles. This helps in understanding market sentiment without manually reading all the articles.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**yfinance Library**

We utilize the yfinance library to retrieve historical stock price data for your selected company. This includes daily open, high, low, and close prices over the past six months. The data is used to calculate technical indicators like RSI and ATR, which help assess stock performance and volatility.
""")

st.sidebar.subheader("What is RSI?")
st.sidebar.write("""
A higher RSI may mean the stock's price has risen quickly and could drop soon, while a lower RSI might mean it's a good time to buy as the price could rise.
""")

st.sidebar.subheader("RSI Explainer")
st.sidebar.write("""
Imagine you're shopping, and you notice an item that's suddenly much more expensive than usualâ€”that's like a high RSI, suggesting it might not be the best time to buy. Conversely, if the item is cheaper than normal (low RSI), it might be a good opportunity to purchase.
""")

st.sidebar.subheader("What is ATR?")
st.sidebar.write("""
A higher ATR means the stock price moves a lot during the day, which can be risky but also offer more opportunities for profit. A lower ATR means the price is steadier, which might be safer but with smaller gains.
""")

st.sidebar.subheader("ATR Explainer")
st.sidebar.write("""
Think of the stock market like the weather. On a windy day (high ATR), things can change rapidly, and you need to be prepared. On a calm day (low ATR), you can expect steadier conditions.

**Sentiment Analysis**

Sentiment Analysis involves evaluating news articles to determine the overall sentimentâ€”positive, negative, or neutralâ€”towards a company or topic. In our app, we analyze aggregated news to gauge market sentiment, which can influence stock price movements and aid in making informed investment decisions.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Machine Learning Model**

We utilize a gradient boosted machine learning model that analyzes the past week's market data and average sentiment scores to predict stock price movements for the next week. This model helps forecast whether the stock is likely to trend upward or downward based on historical patterns and current sentiment. Model: Gradient Boosted Model (GradientBoostingClassifier); Model Features: learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, max_features='sqrt', min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2, n_estimators=100, subsample=1.0, random_state=42
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Volatility Percentage**

Volatility Percentage represents the stock's average price movement as a percentage of its current price. It is calculated by dividing the Average True Range (ATR) by the latest closing price and multiplying by 100. This metric helps you understand how much the stock price typically fluctuates, indicating the level of market risk.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Overbought/Oversold Conditions**

These conditions are identified using the RSI indicator. An RSI above 70 suggests the stock is overbought, meaning it may have risen too quickly and could be due for a pullback. An RSI below 30 indicates the stock is oversold, suggesting it may be undervalued and could experience a price increase.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Volatility**

Volatility refers to the degree of variation in a stock's price over time. A higher volatility means the stock price fluctuates significantly, indicating higher risk and potential reward. We use the ATR to measure volatility, helping you understand how much the stock price moves on average.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Momentum**

Momentum measures the rate at which a stock's price is changing. Positive momentum indicates the price is rising, while negative momentum suggests it is falling. In our app, we assess momentum through indicators like RSI to help identify potential trends in stock price movements.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Bullish/Bearish Trends**

A bullish trend signifies that the stock price is moving upward, reflecting market optimism. A bearish trend indicates a downward movement, reflecting pessimism. Understanding these trends helps investors make decisions about buying or selling stocks. Our app identifies these trends using technical analysis and sentiment data.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Stock Ticker Symbol**

A stock ticker symbol is a unique series of letters assigned to a publicly traded company. It is used to identify the company on stock exchanges and financial markets. In our app, you input the ticker symbol to fetch specific stock data and news articles for that company.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Technical Indicators**

Technical indicators are mathematical calculations based on historical price and volume data used to predict future stock movements. In our app, we calculate indicators like RSI and ATR to analyze stock performance, helping you understand market trends and make informed decisions.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Moving Averages**

A moving average smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. This helps identify the direction of a trend. While our app focuses on RSI and ATR, moving averages are also important technical indicators commonly used in market analysis.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Market Sentiment**

Market sentiment reflects the overall attitude of investors towards a particular stock or financial market. It is influenced by news, economic indicators, and market trends. Our app gauges market sentiment through sentiment analysis of news articles, providing insights into how the market views a company.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**Headline Summarization**

We use the OpenAI API to generate concise summaries of news headlines fetched via the Bing News Search API. This provides you with an overview of the most important news affecting the stock, saving you time from reading each article individually.
""")

st.sidebar.write("""
**News Articles Aggregation**

Our app aggregates news articles related to your selected company or topic using the Bing News Search API. By collecting multiple sources of information, we provide a comprehensive view of current events and sentiments that may impact stock performance.
